/*
This implements a way of representing surfaces that makes it efficient to check for overlap and
do alignment of patch and surface.

A surface is represented as a collection of patches, without bothering about removing patch intersections (because rendering will deal with that).

Each patch is a list of:
qx,qy,vx,vy,vz

where qx,qy are the floating point quadmesh coords within the patch and
vx,vy,vz are floating point scroll voxel coords.

A surface is a collection of patches represented as a list of:
qx,qy,vx,vy,vz,pid

For convenvience, points are added and compressed one patch at a time, but when using the data this cannot be assumed - points and patches
could be in any order within a chunk. For example, the boundary tracking routines will sometimes rewrite an entire chunk as a single
compressed block containing all patches within that chunk.

Where pid is the id of the patch that the point belongs to and qx,qy are the patch-local quadmesh coordinates

The list is stored in a compressed chunked format, chunked on the vx,vy,vz coords,
compressed using blosc2.
