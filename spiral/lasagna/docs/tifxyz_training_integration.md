# Deriving 3D UNet Training Channels On-the-Fly from Tifxyz Surfaces

## Overview

This document describes how to derive the 8 lasagna training channels (cos,
grad_mag, 6× direction) on-the-fly from tifxyz surfaces during 3D UNet
training, and outlines integration approaches with the vesuvius training
framework.

### Goal

Train a 3D UNet (CT volume → 8-channel field prediction) using tifxyz surfaces
as the source of ground truth, rather than pre-computing label zarrs from
`lasagna_fit_data.py`. This avoids the need for a fitted lasagna model as a
prerequisite and can leverage the large collection of tifxyz surfaces already
used by the neural tracer.

### Current data

- **CT volumes**: zarr arrays at full resolution (ZYX layout)
- **Tifxyz surfaces**: directory-based surface format (`x.tif`, `y.tif`,
  `z.tif`, `meta.json`) representing 2D grids of 3D (x, y, z) coordinates.
  Each surface is a segmented papyrus sheet layer. The vesuvius `Tifxyz` class
  (`vesuvius/src/vesuvius/tifxyz/types.py`) provides:
  - Per-vertex 3D coordinates at stored or full resolution
  - Per-vertex surface normals via `compute_normals()` or tile-based
    `get_normals()` (cross product of central-difference tangent vectors)
  - A validity mask
  - Label loading (e.g. ink labels)
- **Multiple surfaces per region**: when multiple tifxyz surfaces exist in the
  same volume region, they represent distinct sheet layers of the scroll

## 1. Available Training Data

### S3 bucket

The neural tracer datasets are available at:

```
s3://philodemos/paul/neural-tracer-datasets/nt_dataset_022026/
```

### Dataset config (6 scrolls)

The following JSON config defines the 6 datasets used for neural tracer
training. Paths shown are local (`/mnt/raid_nvme/...`) — adapt to your
environment (S3, HTTPS `volumes.aws.ash2txt.org`, or local mount).

```json
"datasets": [
    {
        "volume_path": "/mnt/raid_nvme/volpkgs/PHerc0139_ds2.volpkg/volumes/0139_2um_ds2_raw.zarr",

        "volume_scale": 0,
        "segments_path": "/mnt/raid_nvme/datasets/raw/neural_tracer_022826/PHerc1667/tifxyz",
        "z_range": [3500, 9000]
    },
    {

        "z_range": [1314, 3000]
    },
    {

        "z_range": [1000, 3000]
    },
    {
        "volume_path": "/mnt/raid_nvme/volpkgs/0500P2.volpkg/volumes/111keV_1.2m_scroll-fragment-0500P2_8um.zarr",
        "volume_scale": 0,
        "segments_path": "/mnt/raid_nvme/datasets/raw/neural_tracer_022826/PHerc0500p2/tifxyz",
        "z_range": [1700, 6000]
    }
]
```

### z_range

Each dataset specifies a `z_range: [lo, hi]` defining the safe Z-slice range
for that scroll. Regions outside this range extend beyond the physical scroll
(e.g. above/below the rolled papyrus) and should be excluded from training.
The patch-finding code in `vesuvius/src/vesuvius/neural_tracing/datasets/patch_finding.py`
filters segments via `_segment_overlaps_z_range()` from `common.py`.

### Volume access

CT volumes are opened via `vesuvius.neural_tracing.datasets.common.open_zarr()`,
which handles local paths, S3 (`s3://...`), and HTTPS
(`https://volumes.aws.ash2txt.org/...`) using fsspec. For authenticated HTTPS
access, pass an `auth_json_path` pointing to a JSON file with
`{"username": "...", "password": "..."}`.

**Remote paths require `volume_cache_dir` in config.** When set, fsspec's
`filecache` protocol caches each zarr chunk locally on first access, so
subsequent reads (across epochs and training runs) are served from local disk.
Without `volume_cache_dir`, remote paths raise a `ValueError` to prevent
accidental uncached streaming.

```json
{
    "volume_cache_dir": "/mnt/raid_nvme/zarr_cache",
    "datasets": [
        {
            "volume_path": "s3://philodemos/full-scrolls/PHerc0139/volumes/0139_2um_ds2_raw.zarr",
            "volume_scale": 0,
            "segments_path": "/local/path/to/PHerc0139/tifxyz",
            "z_range": [2000, 7000]
        }
    ]
}
```

The `find_world_chunk_patches()` call (via `open_zarr()`) handles per-dataset
volume access, so switching from local to remote volumes only requires
changing `volume_path` and adding `volume_cache_dir`.

### Tifxyz surface access

The tifxyz reader (`vesuvius.tifxyz.io.read_tifxyz()`) currently expects a
local filesystem path — it reads `x.tif`, `y.tif`, `z.tif` and `meta.json`
from a directory. For S3-hosted datasets, two options:

1. **Sync locally first** — `aws s3 sync` the tifxyz directories to a local
   path and point `segments_path` there. Simplest approach; surfaces are small
   relative to volumes.
2. **Extend the reader** — add fsspec-backed I/O to `TifxyzReader` so it can
   open TIFF files from S3 directly. Not yet implemented.

## 2. What Tifxyz Surfaces Provide

A `Tifxyz` object (`vesuvius.tifxyz.types.Tifxyz`) stores a surface as a 2D
grid where each grid cell has a 3D position `(x, y, z)` in volume coordinates.
Key capabilities:

| Property | Source | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| 3D position (x,y,z) | `_x`, `_y`, `_z` arrays | Stored at reduced resolution; bicubic upsample to full res |
| Surface normals (nx,ny,nz) | `compute_normals()` | Cross product of central differences, cached, NaN at boundaries |
| Validity mask | `_valid_mask` property | `z > 0` and `isfinite(z)`, plus optional `mask.tif` |
| Scale | `_scale` tuple | Grid spacing: stored-res → full-res factor |
| Labels | `load_label(selector)` | Associated label TIFFs (e.g. ink labels) |

The neural tracing pipeline (`vesuvius/src/vesuvius/neural_tracing/datasets/`)
provides:
- World-chunk patch tiling
  (`patch_finding.py:find_world_chunk_patches()`)
- Surface extraction and upsampling
  (`common.py:_upsample_world_triplet()`, `_trim_to_world_bbox()`)
- Voxelizing surface grids into 3D volumes (`common.py:voxelize_surface_grid_masked()`)
- Reading CT volume crops from zarr (`common.py:_read_volume_crop_from_patch()`)

## 3. Deriving the 8 Training Channels from Tifxyz

The 8 target channels from `3d_unet_training.md` are: **cos** (1ch),
**grad_mag** (1ch), **dir_z** (2ch), **dir_y** (2ch), **dir_x** (2ch).

### 3.1 Direction channels (6ch) — straightforward

The 6 direction channels encode surface normal projections as double-angle
representations. These are directly derivable from tifxyz normals:

```python
nx, ny, nz = segment.compute_normals()  # at stored resolution

eps = 1e-8
def _encode_dir(gx, gy):
    r2 = gx*gx + gy*gy + eps
    cos2t = (gx*gx - gy*gy) / r2
    sin2t = 2.0*gx*gy / r2
    d0 = 0.5 + 0.5 * cos2t
    d1 = 0.5 + 0.5 * (cos2t - sin2t) / np.sqrt(2.0)
    return d0, d1

dir0_z, dir1_z = _encode_dir(nx, ny)   # Z-slices (XY plane)
dir0_y, dir1_y = _encode_dir(nx, nz)   # Y-slices (XZ plane)
dir0_x, dir1_x = _encode_dir(ny, nz)   # X-slices (YZ plane)
```

These can be computed per grid point and then voxelized into the 3D patch
(using the same splatting approach as the neural tracer).

### 3.2 Surface chain ordering (geometry + filename-winding)

The data loader returns tifxyz surfaces in no particular spatial order, and
all DT-derived channels (cos, grad_mag, validity) need to know which
surfaces are chain-adjacent. Earlier versions of this pipeline scanned
pairwise DT means to greedily build a single chain; **that approach is
gone**. We now:

1. Reuse the neural tracer's triplet-neighbor logic to order surfaces once
   per patch, based on (a) each wrap's 2D median position in surface
   parameter space and (b) compatibility via consecutive `w<N>` filename
   winding ids.
2. Support **multiple independent chains** in the same patch (branches,
   disconnected sheet stacks).
3. Hand the ordering to the label-derivation step as `surface_chain_info`
   metadata — EDTs are only used for bracketing distances, never for
   ordering.

The ordering is implemented in `lasagna/tifxyz_lasagna_dataset.py`:

```python
def build_patch_chains(patch, max_wraps: int) -> dict:
    # 1. For each wrap, compute a 2D median (x, y) over its stored
    #    coordinates via _compute_wrap_order_stats.
    # 2. Sort wraps along the dominant-spread axis (x or y).
    # 3. Link each wrap to its nearest compatible neighbor on each side.
    #    Compatibility = same segment, or consecutive w<N> winding ids.
    # 4. Walk reciprocal next-links from chain heads to form chains;
    #    asymmetric leftovers become singleton chains.
    # Returns: {wrap_idx: {chain, pos, has_prev, has_next, label}}
```

This is a port of `_build_triplet_neighbor_lookup` in
`vesuvius/src/vesuvius/neural_tracing/datasets/dataset_rowcol_cond.py`, so
lasagna and the neural tracer agree on chain topology. The helpers
`_compute_wrap_order_stats`, `_extract_wrap_ids`, and
`_triplet_wraps_compatible` are imported from
`vesuvius.neural_tracing.datasets.common`.

The dataset's `__getitem__` calls `build_patch_chains` once per patch and
emits a `surface_chain_info` list aligned with the retained `surface_masks`,
carrying `{chain, pos, has_prev, has_next}` per mask. This is collated
through to the training step and forwarded to `compute_patch_labels`.

### 3.3 Cos, grad_mag, and validity — chain-aware DT derivation

With chains already in hand (§3.2), every voxel needs:
1. Its **globally nearest surface** (across all chains).
2. Whether that surface has a chain neighbor on the side this voxel sits.
3. The **bracketing distances** to the two surfaces it lies between.

All three come from **DT-gradient dot products**. The implementation lives
in `lasagna/tifxyz_labels.py:derive_cos_gradmag_validity()`.

#### DT-gradient dot product — core idea

Given two distance transforms `dt_A` and `dt_B`, compute `∇dt_A · ∇dt_B`:

- **dot < 0** → gradients oppose → the voxel is **between** surfaces A and B.
- **dot ≥ 0** → gradients agree → the voxel is on the **same side** of both.

This works because `∇dt` always points away from the nearest surface point.
Between two surfaces the "away" directions oppose; outside both they align.

#### Between-neighbors validity ("only between neighboring surfaces")

The new validity rule is strict: **a voxel is supervised for cos/grad_mag
only if it is strictly between its nearest surface and one of that
surface's chain-adjacent neighbors.** This removes the old
`~outside_envelope` mask entirely — we no longer fabricate validity for
voxels on the open side of a chain endpoint.

For each chain, for each position `pos` in the chain, for each voxel whose
nearest surface is the one at `pos`:

```python
# has_prev, has_next come from chain position (not from DT scanning)
if has_prev:
    dot_prev = sum(grad(dt_near)[k] * grad(dt_prev)[k] for k in (0,1,2))
    between_prev = (dot_prev < 0) & is_nearest
if has_next:
    dot_next = sum(grad(dt_near)[k] * grad(dt_next)[k] for k in (0,1,2))
    between_next = (dot_next < 0) & is_nearest

use_prev = between_prev                       # prefer prev when both sides qualify
use_next = between_next & ~use_prev
local_valid = use_prev | use_next             # only bracketed voxels
```

Consequences:
- Chain middles with neighbors on both sides supervise both sides.
- Chain endpoints supervise only the side that has an actual neighbor.
- Chain-of-one surfaces contribute zero valid voxels.
- Outside-envelope voxels fail both `between_prev` and `between_next` and
  are automatically invalid.
- Multiple independent chains in the same patch are handled naturally:
  global nearest-surface assignment routes each voxel to the chain it
  belongs to.

**Near-surface carve-out (1-voxel halo).** The dt-gradient
between-ness test is unreliable in a 1-voxel halo around every
rasterized surface, for three distinct reasons:

1. **On-surface (`dt_near = 0`)**: the central-difference gradient of
   `dt_near` collapses to ~0 (neighbours are at `dt = 1` on both
   sides), so the dot product is ~0 and the strict `< 0` check rejects
   the voxel.
2. **Adjacent (`dt_near = 1`)**: along axes parallel to a flat
   surface, central differences give `(1 − 1)/2 = 0`, so
   `grad(dt_near)` collapses to a single nonzero component. If
   `grad(dt_prev)` happens to put its nonzero component on a different
   axis (curved or non-coplanar prev), the dot is exactly 0 — again
   rejected by `< 0`.
3. **`argmin` tie-break**: at voxels equidistant from two surfaces
   (sheets two voxels apart, intersections), `nearest_surf` picks the
   lower index. The "loser" surface never processes that voxel, and
   the winner's gradient test may also fail — leaving an isolated
   one-voxel hole in cos *and* grad_mag.

We therefore OR `(dt_near < 1.5) & is_nearest` into the
prev/next eligibility masks before routing. The bracketing formula
degrades gracefully across the halo: at `dt_near = 0` it produces
`cos = 1`; at `dt_near = 1` it produces `cos ≈ 0.976`, matching the
value the dt test already gives at the next voxel out — no
discontinuity.

**Routing precedence.** When the dt-gradient test does fire correctly
on a near-surface voxel, we trust it: `between_prev` / `between_next`
take precedence over the carve-out for the prev/next routing decision.
The carve-out only gets to choose the side for voxels where *neither*
between-ness check succeeded (the genuinely-degenerate cases). This
preserves the geometric correctness of in-gap supervision — e.g. in a
3-surface chain, a `dt_near = 1` voxel just to one side of the middle
surface gets bracketed by the gap it actually sits in, not the
opposite gap.

A consequence of the wider halo: the carve-out admits voxels exactly
1 step *outside* a chain endpoint surface as well (since they have
`dt_near = 1`). They get a smooth extrapolation of the cos signal
(`cos ≈ 0.976`, `grad_mag ≈ 1/(spacing + 1)`), which is mild and
geometrically smooth supervision noise rather than a contradiction.

#### Bracketing distances, cos and grad_mag

```python
d_lo = torch.where(use_prev, dt_prev, dt_near)
d_hi = torch.where(use_prev, dt_near, dt_next)
spacing = d_lo + d_hi
frac = d_lo / (spacing + 1e-6)                       # 0 at "lo", 1 at "hi"
cos      = 0.5 + 0.5 * torch.cos(2.0 * math.pi * frac)
grad_mag = 1.0 / (spacing + 1e-6)
```

`cos` is a **full-period** winding encoding across each inter-sheet gap:
it peaks at 1.0 on each sheet, dips to 0.0 midway, and rises back to 1.0
on the opposing sheet. `grad_mag` encodes inverse inter-sheet spacing.
Both are assigned only at voxels where `local_valid` is true, leaving
the rest at 0 and excluded from the loss via the validity mask.

**Note** — earlier revisions used a half-period formula
(`cos(π·clamp(d_lo/(spacing/2), 0, 1))`) that clamped the second half of
every gap to 0 and produced a step discontinuity at the midway boundary
between the `use_prev` and `use_next` branches. The current full-period
formula removes the clamp and uses a true sinusoid across the whole
gap, verified via a synthetic two-plane unit check
(`profile[x] == 0.5 + 0.5·cos(2π·(x-x_lo)/spacing)` to within 1e-3).

#### Direction channels and masking

Direction channels (`dir_z`, `dir_y`, `dir_x`) are supervised **densely
inside the cos validity bracket** by slerp-blending raw normals and
encoding once at the end.

The dataset splats **raw ZYX normals** (not the 6-channel encoding)
via `_splat_multichannel` into `batch["raw_normals"]` shape
`(3, Z, Y, X)`, plus a splat validity mask `batch["normals_valid"]`.
`derive_cos_gradmag_validity` then densifies in the same per-chain
loop used for cos:

1. Per-wrap EDTs are built with `edt_torch_with_indices` so each wrap
   also gets a feature transform `(3, Z, Y, X)` pointing to the ZYX
   coordinate of the nearest on-wrap voxel. In the training loop
   `compute_batch_targets` does a joint dts+fts pass and threads both
   into `compute_patch_labels` via `precomputed_dts` /
   `precomputed_fts`.
2. Inside the per-chain-position block, after the bracket masks
   (`use_prev`, `use_next`) and the cos fraction
   `frac = d_lo / (d_lo + d_hi)` are computed, the **raw normals**
   at the two bracketing wraps are gathered at those feature-transform
   indices and combined via `slerp_unit(n_lo, n_hi, frac)`. Slerp is
   sign-invariant (flips `n2` to `n1`'s hemisphere for the shorter
   arc) with a lerp fallback for near-parallel vectors. This blends
   in angle space — linearly blending the encoded
   `(d0, d1)` channels would be wrong because the double-angle
   encoding is nonlinear in θ.
3. `apply_same_surface_merge` recomputes feature transforms from the
   unioned mask for merged groups, so the lookup stays exact after
   same-surface collapse.
4. After the chain loop, `compute_patch_labels` sparse-overrides
   `n_dense` with the dataset-splatted `raw_normals` wherever
   `normals_valid` is `True` — those voxels keep their exact
   ground-truth normals. Then it calls `encode_direction_channels(nx,
   ny, nz)` **once** to produce the final 6-channel `targets[2:8]`.
5. Per-plane relevance weights are derived from the densified raw
   normal: `w_z = √(nx² + ny²)`, `w_y = √(nx² + nz²)`,
   `w_x = √(ny² + nz²)`, giving a `(6, Z, Y, X)` `dir_axis_weight`
   tensor. Voxels whose normal is perpendicular to a slice plane get
   near-zero weight on that plane's direction pair — the double-angle
   encoding there is degenerate noise. This matches the old
   `train_unet_3d.py:278-282` per-plane weighting.
6. Two boolean masks are returned separately: `dir_sparse_mask`
   (splatted wrap voxels, hard ground truth) and `dir_dense_mask`
   (bracket fill from the slerp blend). `compute_batch_targets`
   stacks them alongside `dir_axis_weight` and hands all three to
   the train loop, which runs the direction MSE twice — once per
   mask, both with `weight=dir_axis_weight` — logging
   `train/loss_dir_sparse` and `train/loss_dir_dense` separately so
   the hard wrap-voxel error is visible independent of the softer
   bracket fill.

Two earlier attempts were wrong and got replaced:

- A global-top-2-closest densifier blended the two nearest wraps per
  voxel → visible streaks at Voronoi boundaries and cross-chain
  leaks.
- Blending encoded `direction_channels` linearly at the
  chain-adjacent bracket → midpoints shrank toward 0.5 in encoded
  space (the encoding is nonlinear in θ).

See `lasagna/tifxyz_labels.py:derive_cos_gradmag_validity` and
`tifxyz_labels.slerp_unit` for the implementation.

## 4. Voxelization Strategy

Each training sample is a (CT patch, label patch) pair. The CT patch is a 3D
crop at full resolution. The label patch contains the 8 channels at step
resolution (fullres / scaledown).

To produce labels on-the-fly from tifxyz surfaces for a given patch:

```
1. Identify which tifxyz surfaces intersect this patch's world bbox
2. Build chains for this patch once via build_patch_chains():
   → per-wrap {chain, pos, has_prev, has_next}
3. For each surface k (that survived chain/bbox filtering):
   a. Bicubic-upsample surface grid from stored to full resolution
   b. Sample the surface grid within the padded bbox
   c. Compute raw normals at the sampled grid points (no encoding yet)
   d. Voxelize into a per-surface binary mask (mask_k)
4. Splat raw normals:
   a. _splat_multichannel(points, normals_zyx (N, 3), crop_size)
      → raw_normals (3, Z, Y, X), normals_valid (Z, Y, X)
   → normals_valid is the SPARSE mask used later to tag voxels that
     keep their original splat value (dir_sparse_mask) vs voxels
     filled by the chain-adjacent slerp blend (dir_dense_mask). The
     6-channel double-angle encoding is derived downstream in one
     place.
5. Per-surface distance transforms + feature transforms + chain-aware
   bracketing + direction densification (§3.3):
   a. For each surface k: (dt_k, ft_k) = edt_with_indices(~mask_k).
      The feature transform ft_k gives, at every voxel, the ZYX of
      the nearest on-wrap voxel (used to gather raw normals).
   b. Global nearest-surface assignment across all chains/surfaces
   c. Per-voxel between-neighbors detection via grad dot products with
      the surface's chain-adjacent neighbors (only; no envelope search)
   d. cos and grad_mag from bracketing distances (d_lo, d_hi);
      frac = d_lo / (d_lo + d_hi)
   e. n_dense(v) = slerp_unit(
           raw_normals[ft_lo(v)], raw_normals[ft_hi(v)], frac(v),
      ) — sign-invariant spherical interpolation in angle space,
      in the same loop as (d), same routing, same frac
   f. validity = (between_prev) | (between_next) per voxel
   g. Sparse override: n_final = raw_normals where normals_valid
      else n_dense. Then encode_direction_channels(nx, ny, nz)
      once → targets[2:8]. Per-plane relevance weights come from
      n_final via √(·² + ·²) → dir_axis_weight (6, Z, Y, X).
      Masks: dir_sparse_mask (wrap voxels, weight 1.0 upstream),
      dir_dense_mask (bracket fill, weight 0.1 upstream).
6. Average-pool to step resolution if needed
```

The splatting infrastructure already exists in the neural tracer:
- `_voxelize_surface_from_sampled_grid()` — splats binary surface presence
- `_build_normal_offset_mask_from_labeled_points()` — splats along normals
- `_splat_points_trilinear_numba()` — numba-accelerated trilinear splatting

We extend this to splat multi-channel values (not just binary presence).

## 5. Integration Approaches

### Approach A: New dataset class (like TifxyzInkDataset) — IMPLEMENTED

Implemented in `lasagna/tifxyz_lasagna_dataset.py` as `TifxyzLasagnaDataset`.

- Uses `find_world_chunk_patches()` from `vesuvius/neural_tracing/datasets/patch_finding.py`
  which tiles the volume into 3D chunks and finds surface wraps within each
  chunk. Results are cached to `.patch_cache/world_chunks_*.json` per segments
  directory.
- In `__getitem__`, reads a CT crop and voxelizes surface masks + direction channels
- EDT, chain ordering, cos/grad_mag derivation happen on GPU in the train step
  via `lasagna/tifxyz_labels.py:compute_patch_labels()`

**Key implementation details:**
- `find_world_chunk_patches()` handles patch discovery with caching; each chunk
  contains pre-computed wraps with segment references and 2D bboxes
- Multi-surface wraps: each chunk's wraps are voxelized into separate masks,
  raw normals are splatted from all wraps combined
- Multi-channel trilinear splatting via `_splat_multichannel_trilinear_numba()`
  (numba) with numpy fallback

**`__getitem__` returns:**
```python
{
    "image":              # (1, Z, Y, X) float32 — CT crop in [0, 1]
    "surface_masks":      # (N, Z, Y, X) float32 — per-surface binary voxelization
    "raw_normals":        # (3, Z, Y, X) float32 — sparse splat of raw ZYX normals.

                          #   AFTER chain-adjacent slerp-blending, so this is

}
```

### Approach B: Preprocessing script + ZarrDataset

Pre-compute label zarrs from tifxyz surfaces, then use the standard
`ZarrDataset` for training.

**Script: `tifxyz_to_lasagna_labels.py`**

```
For each tifxyz surface collection:
  1. Load all surfaces in the region
  2. Voxelize normals + per-surface binary masks into 3D volumes
  3. Per-surface distance transforms → sort → d1, d2 per voxel
  4. Derive cos (from d1, d2) and grad_mag (1/(d1+d2))
  5. Encode direction channels from splatted normals
  6. Compute validity mask (≥2 surfaces, d2 < threshold, boundary erosion)
  7. Write label zarrs matching ZarrDataset's expected layout:
     labels/region_cos.zarr, labels/region_grad_mag.zarr, etc.
```

Then train with the existing vesuvius pipeline:
```yaml
dataset_config:
  data_path: ./training_data
  targets:
    cos: { out_channels: 1, losses: [{name: MSELoss, weight: 1.0}] }
    grad_mag: { out_channels: 1, losses: [{name: SmoothL1Loss, weight: 1.0}] }
    dir_z: { out_channels: 2, losses: [{name: MSELoss, weight: 1.0}] }
    dir_y: { out_channels: 2, losses: [{name: MSELoss, weight: 1.0}] }
    dir_x: { out_channels: 2, losses: [{name: MSELoss, weight: 1.0}] }
```

**Pros:**
- Minimal code — reuses entire vesuvius training stack
- Label computation is a one-time cost
- Easy to inspect/debug labels before training
- ZarrDataset handles patch validation, normalization, augmentation

**Cons:**
- Storage overhead for label zarrs
- Preprocessing step before training
- Less flexible — changing label derivation requires re-running preprocessing

### Approach C: Hybrid — ZarrDataset with on-the-fly transform

Extend `ZarrDataset` with a custom transform that reads sparse tifxyz data
and computes labels on-the-fly. The "labels" stored in zarr would be
lightweight (e.g. just a validity mask), and the real labels are computed in
the transform from tifxyz data.

This is more complex and less natural than Approach A or B.

### Approach D: Extend BaseTrainer with custom dataset hook

The vesuvius `BaseTrainer` builds its dataset via `_configure_dataset()`. We
can subclass `BaseTrainer` to override this method and return a
`TifxyzLasagnaDataset` instead of `ZarrDataset`, while keeping everything else
(loss, optimizer, checkpointing, DDP) from the base trainer.

```python
class LasagnaTrainer(BaseTrainer):
    def _configure_dataset(self):
        train_ds = TifxyzLasagnaDataset(self.mgr, split="train")
        val_ds = TifxyzLasagnaDataset(self.mgr, split="val")
        return train_ds, val_ds
```

**Pros:**
- Reuses all of BaseTrainer (loss building, optimizer, scheduler, DDP,
  checkpointing, metrics, logging)
- Clean separation: dataset logic in TifxyzLasagnaDataset, training logic in
  BaseTrainer

**Cons:**
- BaseTrainer's `_train_step` expects specific dict keys from the dataset;
  need to match that interface

## 7. Chosen Approach

**Approach A (on-the-fly dataset)** was implemented directly, skipping the
preprocessing phase. The neural tracing pipeline's `find_world_chunk_patches()`
uses pre-computed `.patch_cache/world_chunks_*.json` files, loading cached
patches instantly with no progress bars or recomputation.

### Implementation files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `lasagna/tifxyz_lasagna_dataset.py` | `TifxyzLasagnaDataset` (CT crops, surface masks, direction channels), `build_patch_chains()` (geometry + filename-winding ordering), `collate_variable_surfaces()` (passes chain info through the batch) |
| `lasagna/tifxyz_labels.py` | `compute_patch_labels()`, `chains_from_surface_info()`, `derive_cos_gradmag_validity()` — chain-aware cos/grad_mag with between-neighbors masking |
| `lasagna/train_tifxyz.py` | Training script; `compute_batch_targets()` forwards `surface_chain_info` to label derivation |
| `lasagna/lasagna3d/` | `python -m lasagna3d` analysis CLI (`dataset vis` renders three-plane JPEGs with chain-colored overlays — see [`lasagna3d_cli.md`](lasagna3d_cli.md)) |

### Multi-channel splatting

The multi-channel trilinear splatting kernel
(`_splat_multichannel_trilinear_numba`) is implemented in
`lasagna/tifxyz_lasagna_dataset.py` with a numpy fallback when numba is unavailable.

### Handling multiple surfaces in one patch

When a patch contains multiple tifxyz surfaces (multiple sheet layers), each
surface is voxelized into its own binary mask and a shared direction-channel
volume. The direction splatting naturally handles overlap: each surface
contributes values near its location, and the weight normalization averages
overlapping contributions.

The per-surface distance transforms are then computed independently. At each
voxel, sorting the K distance values gives d1 and d2, from which cos and
grad_mag are derived. This naturally handles any number of surfaces — no
inter-surface ordering is required, just the two nearest distances.

For direction channels between surfaces, the normal-offset splatting approach
from `_build_normal_offset_mask_from_labeled_points` can be used to fill the
inter-sheet space (splat along normals).

## 8. Design Decisions

- **Training resolution**: Full resolution. Labels are voxelized at full res;
  the UNet operates at full res and its output is pooled to step res downstream.


---

## 9. Shared GPU-Accelerated EDT Utility

The per-surface distance transforms in §3.2 are the computational bottleneck of
on-the-fly label derivation. A shared GPU-accelerated EDT utility is provided at
`vesuvius.image_proc.edt` to make this fast.

### Location

`vesuvius/src/vesuvius/image_proc/edt.py`

### Public API

```python
from vesuvius.image_proc.edt import distance_transform_edt, signed_distance_field, edt_dilate

# Drop-in replacement for scipy.ndimage.distance_transform_edt
dt = distance_transform_edt(~surface_mask)

# Signed distance field (positive inside, negative outside)
sdf = signed_distance_field(binary_mask)

# Fast binary dilation via EDT thresholding
dilated = edt_dilate(binary_mask, radius_voxels=8)
```

### Backend priority

| Priority | Backend | Package | Notes |
|----------|---------|---------|-------|
| 1 | `cupyx.scipy.ndimage.distance_transform_edt` | `cupy-cuda12x` | GPU PBA 3D, 10-50x faster |
| 2 | `edt.edt()` | `edt` | CPU Felzenszwalb, parallel, ~5-10x faster than scipy |
| 3 | `scipy.ndimage.distance_transform_edt` | `scipy` | CPU baseline, always available |

Backend is resolved once per process and cached. CuPy uses
`float64_distances=False` and a non-blocking stream for async GPU→CPU transfer.

### Installation

GPU acceleration requires CuPy matching your CUDA version:
```bash
pip install cupy-cuda12x   # CUDA 12.x
```

The `edt` package is a good CPU-only fallback:
```bash
pip install edt
```

Neither is required — scipy is always available as the final fallback.

### Usage in tifxyz training (§3.2–3.3)

In `tifxyz_labels.py` each surface gets one EDT of its complement on GPU
plus a **feature transform** (nearest-on-wrap voxel indices) via
`edt_torch_with_indices`, which runs CuPy's distance transform once and
returns both the distances and the indices. Ordering and side detection
come from the externally-provided chains (§3.2), not from scanning
distances; the feature transforms drive the raw-normal slerp blend
inside the same loop:

```python
from lasagna.tifxyz_labels import (
    edt_torch_with_indices, chains_from_surface_info,
    derive_cos_gradmag_validity, encode_direction_channels,
)

dts, fts = [], []
for m in surface_masks:
    d, ft = edt_torch_with_indices((~m).to(torch.uint8))
    dts.append(d); fts.append(ft)
chains = chains_from_surface_info(surface_chain_info)  # [[idx, ...], ...]
cos, grad_mag, valid, n_dense = derive_cos_gradmag_validity(
    dts, surface_masks, chains,
    fts=fts, raw_normals=raw_normals,
)
# Sparse override + last-second encoding happen inside
# compute_patch_labels — n_dense is the slerp-blended dense raw
# normal volume, valid is the bracket mask, and
# encode_direction_channels converts the final normal field into
# the 6-channel double-angle targets[2:8].
```

See `compute_patch_labels` for the full sparse-override +
`encode_direction_channels` + `dir_axis_weight` wiring.

There is no sort or pairwise-mean step — bracketing comes from the chain
neighbors at each position, and between-ness is confirmed via the
DT-gradient dot product (§3.3).

### Origin

Extracted from `vesuvius/src/vesuvius/neural_tracing/datasets/dataset_rowcol_cond.py:62-203`
which has the same CuPy-with-fallback pattern battle-tested in neural tracer training.
