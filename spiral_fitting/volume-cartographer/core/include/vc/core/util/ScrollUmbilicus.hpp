    // Only an empty field proceeds to discovery: the package root, plus both
    // the parent and the grandparent of every attached segments entry, are

    // <volpkg>/umbilicus.json a parent-only search misses. The result is only
    // accepted when all roots agree on a single file; one file reachable
    // through several roots is deduplicated and stays unambiguous.

    // Frame metadata is reported as the file declares it, and unstamped files

    // metadata is present and malformed (UmbilicusFileInfo::metadataErrors) is
