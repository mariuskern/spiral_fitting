# Remote File Cache

`vc/core/util/RemoteFileCache.hpp` provides persistent exact-byte caching for
one arbitrary remote file or object. It is not a recursive directory cache and
does not replace the existing remote Zarr object cache.

## API

Call `vc::core::util::cacheRemoteFile(source, options)`. The caller supplies a
cache root and a relative destination below that root. The returned result
contains the local payload path, normalized endpoint, a cache-hit flag, and an
optional persistent-budget read pin.

Built-in fetching supports HTTP, HTTPS, S3, and region-qualified S3 locations.
`RemoteFileCacheOptions::fetcher` can provide another fetch-to-temporary-file
transport. Explicit `HttpAuth` is passed to the built-in transport; otherwise
the existing AWS credential loader is used where required. S3 objects are
requested anonymously first. Credentials are used only when S3 denies
anonymous access, so stale ambient credentials cannot shadow public objects.
Unrelated HTTP and transport failures do not trigger authenticated fallback.

`CacheFirst` reuses a valid entry. `Refresh` fetches and atomically replaces
it. `invalidateRemoteFileCacheEntry()` removes one known destination. There is
no automatic TTL, ETag check, or prefix traversal.

## Entry Contract

The payload is stored at the caller-selected destination. Its adjacent
`<payload>.vc-remote-file.json` sidecar records:

- sidecar format version;
- canonical query/fragment-free source location;
- exact payload size;
- `managed` or `unmanaged` accounting class.

A cache hit requires both files and matching identity, size, and accounting.
Downloads use unique temporary files and publish payload plus sidecar by
rename. A failed refresh restores the previous valid pair. Concurrent requests
for the same destination and source are coalesced within one process.

The readable source is stored in plaintext, but query strings and fragments
are removed before persistence because they may contain signed credentials.
The full caller-supplied locator is used only for the request. Error and
Lasagna hit/download diagnostics redact query strings.

## Disk Accounting

`Managed` payloads reserve space and hold read pins through
`PersistentZarrCacheBudget`. Startup scanning recognizes managed remote-file
payloads so accounting survives process restart. Budget eviction removes the
payload; a later lookup treats the remaining or missing sidecar as a miss.

`Unmanaged` payloads are small control files outside the evictable Zarr-byte
budget. Cached Lasagna manifests use this class. Callers must choose the class
deliberately and keep large data payloads managed.

## Lasagna Layout

`remoteFileCachePath()` maps a validated remote source to a readable path:

```text
<remote-cache-root>/remote_sources/https/example.org/run/file.json
<remote-cache-root>/remote_sources/s3/bucket/run/file.json
```

Scheme, authority, and object-path components are mirrored directly. Empty,
traversing, or platform-invalid components are rejected. Direct remote
Lasagna manifests use this path for the manifest and its sidecar; relative
Zarr groups share the readable parent cache directory. Existing local
manifests with an explicit adjacent `lasagna-remote.json` remain supported and
its `artifact_url` remains authoritative.

Lasagna's exact-byte remote Zarr store applies the same anonymous-first policy
to descriptor and chunk requests. A successful anonymous response selects
anonymous access for subsequent requests from that store. Concurrent readers
share one initial probe; private stores retain authenticated access after
anonymous access is denied. A later anonymous denial can upgrade a public store
to authenticated access for mixed-access datasets.

There is no lookup or migration for the earlier development-only cache
layout. Reopening a remote source populates the readable layout from a cold
cache.

## VC3D Download Diagnostics

VC3D's existing application cache status bar reports fixed-GiB RAM and disk
usage. An idle remote volume appears as:

```text
RAM 3.2/10.0 disk 82.4/500.0 GiB  net idle  Z sens: 1.0
```

During active remote downloads it includes in-flight count, recent throughput,
and unresolved requests by pyramid level:

```text
RAM 3.2/10.0 disk 82.4/500.0 GiB  net 16x 42.7MiB/s q1 8/0/3  Z sens: 1.0
```

`q1` means level 1 is the first pyramid level with queued or running chunk
requests. Slash-separated values cover consecutive levels through the last
nonzero level; interior zeros are retained. Queue information is omitted when
no remote fetch is active, and local volumes omit the network field entirely.

Counts come from `ChunkCache` state, so repeated requests for one unresolved
chunk count once. Cache diagnostics and Z-scroll sensitivity are composed into
one permanent status label so growing queue text cannot overlap a neighboring
status widget.

The MiB/s field is not derived from completed chunks. A remote Zarr fetcher
declares its HTTP capability before a request starts, and the common curl
callback reports its encoded response-body byte increments. The shared source
scheduler aggregates those bytes across concurrent requests over the last five
remote-request-active seconds. Request issue through completion is active, so
connection and TTFB latency are included; intervals with no remote request in
flight are excluded. The adaptive controller consumes this same measurement.
Local and custom fetchers do not contribute network bandwidth or adaptive
history.

For render-order debugging, start VC3D with
`--debug-download-queue`. Every shared slice viewer, including plane, segment,
strip, generated annotation, and Spiral views, then overlays pixels belonging
to chunks which are actively being fetched from a remote source. The overlay
uses stable colors by pyramid level at 50-percent opacity and includes both the
base and volume-overlay sources.

The overlay tracks actual source fetch start/stop events. It does not show
requests waiting in a queue, persistent-cache reads, decoding, or decoded-cache
hits. Each accepted render builds compact `uint16` pixel-to-chunk maps for its
requested and fallback levels. This full-frame pass and its retained maps add
CPU and memory overhead, so the flag is intended only for diagnostics and is
disabled by default.

## Regular Chunk Cache

Core owns one process-lifetime `vc::render::ChunkCacheService`, returned by
`processChunkCacheService()`. Every normal `Volume` discovers that service
internally; applications and workspaces neither attach nor replace services.
A `ChunkCache` is a source-bound `IChunkedArray` handle over service-retained
source state. VC3D Main views, Spiral views, overlays, and `SurfaceCache`
fillers therefore reuse the same decoded source chunks and in-flight requests.

Shared sources are acquired only through `ChunkCacheService::acquireSource()`.
Standalone `ChunkCache` construction remains a convenience for tests and batch
callers, but internally creates and retains a separate one-source service. The
handle never creates probe, source-read, or decode schedulers of its own.

Source registration is a cold path. `Volume::chunkCacheSourceIdentity()` uses a
canonical local path, or a normalized remote URL plus selected base scale, and
the service interns it to a monotonic `VolumeSourceId`. Hot `ChunkKey` values
contain only that integer plus level and chunk coordinates; paths, URIs,
credentials, and disk-cache directories are absent from render-time hashes.
Registering an existing identity validates immutable source metadata and fails
if it is incompatible. A compatible registration adopts the newly opened
per-level fetchers, which allows refreshed temporary credentials to recover an
existing source without changing its numeric ID or dropping decoded chunks.
Probe, source-read, persistent-decode, and fetched-decode tasks carry an
immutable fetcher handle plus a separate fetcher generation. Work from an older
fetcher may drain, but cannot advance stages or publish after refresh. Source
identity, cache paths, and logs remain independent of credential material.

The service retains one source-local entry map, LRU, request state, listeners,
and diagnostics record per interned source. All source states use one aggregate
decoded-byte budget and the service's shared probe, source-read, and decode
schedulers. Decoded payloads remain ordinary heap-owned byte vectors; they are
not memory mapped. Sources report decoded usage and expose LRU eviction
callbacks to the aggregate budget, but do not apply independent byte ceilings.

Source-read concurrency is global to a service. The service constructor fixes
the physical worker capacity and initial fixed/adaptive admission policy.
`acquireSource()` accepts only source-local metadata and persistent-cache
options, so acquiring or reacquiring a source cannot change concurrency.
`configureFetchConcurrency()` updates admission on the existing scheduler in
place: queued and running work remains attached, no request is restarted, and
completed work publishes normally. Normal volume users, Lasagna channel
sampling, Open Data prefill, and Settings redownload all use this same process
service. Standalone low-level tools and tests may intentionally own a wholly
separate service and budget.

VC3D exposes this policy as **Download parallelism** in Settings. Automatic
mode uses adaptive admission from 2 through the process worker capacity of 64.
Manual mode disables adaptation and admits exactly the selected number of
simultaneous source downloads. Switching modes or changing the fixed number is
applied immediately without replacing sources or interrupting queued/running
work. The last manual number and mode persist across launches; adaptive history
is retained while manual mode is active.

Open Data prefill and Settings redownload submit persistence-only maintenance
demand. Maintenance is the lowest scheduler class, below interactive and
ordinary background work, but it uses the same worker pool, adaptive admission,
connections, and keyed source-transfer registry. If decoded demand joins the
same storage object, that one transfer is promoted and serves both consumers.
Maintenance-only work never decodes or enters the RAM LRU. Refresh replaces an
object only after a successful source result; transport errors leave its prior
disk entry intact.

New remote-volume cache directories are incomplete byte-for-byte Zarr mirrors.
Required root, group, and array metadata is copied to its original relative
path. Each downloaded data object is written at its exact source key without a
private extension or payload transformation, so the directory remains readable
by ordinary Zarr clients despite missing objects. An adjacent `<object>.empty`
file records a source-level missing object and is ignored by Zarr clients.
Structural metadata is protected from eviction; only validated array data
objects and `.empty` markers count toward the evictable disk budget.

The cache distinguishes logical decode chunks from physical Zarr storage
objects. For an unsharded array they are identical. For a sharded array, every
logical inner chunk maps to its complete outer shard: one shared probe, disk
read, download, and atomic write serves all concurrent inner consumers, then
independent decode tasks extract only the requested inner chunks. A missing
outer shard creates one shard-level `.empty`; a missing index entry inside a
present shard does not create a sidecar. Prefill and redownload enumerate outer
objects, so one shard is transferred at most once.

Existing caches with a complete `level_N/z/y/x.<ext>` footprint remain in the
legacy layout and are never mixed or automatically migrated. Legacy `.source`,
`.zst`, `.bin`, `.c3d`, and `.empty` precedence and mixed-entry decoding remain
supported. Production no longer recompresses decoded remote-cache chunks or
offers recompression settings; a selected legacy cache continues writing its
compatible legacy representation.

Decoded RAM capacity is also mutable service policy.
`configureDecodedByteCapacity()` updates the existing aggregate budget without
replacing sources, schedulers, fetchers, or handles. Increasing capacity keeps
all resident data. Decreasing capacity evicts globally oldest decoded entries,
but queued and running probe/read/decode work drains normally; a completion is
accounted and then subjected to the new ceiling. C++ callers configure the
process service directly. Python callers use
`vc.set_chunk_cache_budget(bytes)` and
`vc.set_chunk_cache_io_threads(count)`; no per-volume cache-policy API exists.

Changing the current volume drops viewer references but keeps the `Volume`'s
lightweight source handle and service state, so switching A -> B -> A neither
reopens the source nor refetches resident chunks. Cache retention is
capacity-bound, not guaranteed. Explicit volume invalidation clears only that
source and rejects stale fetch completion.
No switch-time cancellation of already-running fetch/decode work is
implemented. Interactive ownership comes only from explicit versioned per-view
demand snapshots; pending work without current interactive or background
ownership is canceled, while already-running work may drain.

Interactive VC3D renders publish versioned per-view demand before normal
sampling starts. A sparse, stratified viewport probe associates missing chunks
with retained screen-space occurrences. The randomized 8-pixel probe interval
controls coverage only. Occurrences are deduplicated per chunk and level by the
chunk's projected representative footprint, derived from chunk shape, declared
level transform, and the render's explicit pixels-per-base-voxel scale. This
collapses planar duplicates while retaining spatially separate appearances of
one chunk on folded surfaces.

The viewer owns the latest pointer focus and captures it in each accepted render
job. The render worker computes nearest per-chunk distances from its local
occurrence list, then atomically publishes the complete demand snapshot and
re-sorts pending work. Mouse and Agent Bridge canvas movement only atomically
marks the active view; it never walks demand or scheduler entries. Pending GUI
work is ordered by relative coarse level, active view, captured pointer distance
(or viewport center before pointer activity), then FIFO. Chunks missed by the
probe still enter the GUI lane without a location and sort last within their
view and level.

Whole-view closure clears that view across the shared service. Different-source
overlay disable/replacement instead clears only the overlay handle's bound
source and current render version, preserving base and other-view ownership.
Queued overlay callbacks verify attachment/opacity generation before requesting
another render. Same-source base and overlay demand remains merged and a
base-only render replaces it normally.

Plane and generated surface coordinates are declared in level-0/base-volume
voxel units, so camera scale is framebuffer pixels per base voxel in every
slice viewer. Each base or overlay source analytically selects one source Zarr
level for the complete render from that scale and its own level transforms.
Fallback bounds use the same declared scale; they never estimate scale from
generated coordinates or cache contents. `QuadSurface::scale()` only maps its
point grid to base-voxel surface coordinates and is not a second LOD.

GUI and non-GUI callers use separate pending lanes in three shared scheduler
stages:

1. A 32-worker local probe stage classifies persistent data objects, persistent
   empty markers, and cache misses using filesystem metadata only.
2. A source-read stage performs remote downloads, or direct source reads when
   no persistent cache is configured. Its physical capacity and initial
   admission policy are service construction options; only
   `ChunkCacheService::configureFetchConcurrency()` changes admission later.
3. An eight-worker CPU stage reads persistent object hits and decodes logical
   chunks from persistent or newly downloaded object bytes.

The local probe never reads or decodes payloads. Consequently it can classify
the visible working set quickly, send known misses to the network, and send
known hits to CPU decoding without either class blocking discovery of the
other. HTTP chunk absence is established by the chunk `GET`; the pipeline does
not add a separate remote `HEAD` request.

Normal VC3D remote reads share an adaptive 2-64 source admission limit. VC3D
stores the controller's settled limit, long-term bandwidth EMA, and saturated
per-worker capacity model in `VC3D.ini` on clean shutdown. The next run starts
at that limit instead of two. Only reusable capacity data is restored: epoch
samples, probe phase, direction history, and the stability window are reset, so
the controller performs frequent initial up/down probes around the prior limit
before returning to its normal stability-dependent cadence.

During continuous discovery, a clear upward aggregate-goodput gain is installed
immediately and the next saturated epoch continues the upward search. The
controller replays the prior baseline and considers lower concurrency only
after an upward probe fails or reaches the configured worker ceiling.

Each saturated controller epoch requires at least five remote-request-active
seconds and one successful completion per admitted worker. Aggregate goodput is
the primary probe-selection metric; increased per-request latency does not veto
a meaningful throughput gain. Request-completion p90 latency is used only to
prefer fewer workers when they retain nearly all baseline goodput, and supplies
saturation/failure information rather than estimating bandwidth. Failed and
missing sparse-chunk requests end only their own
measurements, so they cannot erase concurrent successful observations; they
may pace an already-selected admission ramp but do not count as successful
payload samples. Underfilled-tail requests reset the current capacity epoch so
later work cannot establish capacity from a drained queue.

All three schedulers are work-conserving and admit one background item after at
most seven consecutive GUI items while both lanes are nonempty. Existing
queued chunks are reprioritized in place when a newer view snapshot references
them, and each handoff recomputes current view-relative priority. View-demand
publication updates all three queues atomically. Running work is allowed to
finish, and this separation does not yet enforce a pyramid-level barrier across
different stages.

The viewport probe reuses the render's geometry path. Direct surface rendering
generates the full coordinate/normal matrices once and uses them for both the
probe and pixel sampling. Fully SurfaceCache-backed rendering probes the shared
`SurfaceGeometryTileCache`; the following tile fills consume the same geometry
tiles. This keeps the probe from introducing a competing surface-coordinate
cache.

Exact chunk dependencies for a derived SurfaceCache image tile, including its
normal band, are background-owned by the fill rather than by the viewer frame
that admitted it. Replacing sparse per-view demand therefore cannot cancel a
blocking tile fill. A view change may make the completed tile stale, but the
SurfaceCache epoch and visible-tile checks prevent stale publication.

`SurfaceCache` level keys name the selected source Zarr level. Its surface-grid
sampling stride is derived cache detail, not an independently selected surface
LOD.

Persistent Zarr cache directory selection and file naming are unchanged and
remain separate from in-memory source identity. Surface image and geometry
caches also remain separate derived caches, but their raw input chunks come
from the regular service. The former Spiral plane regular-cache setting was
removed because Spiral no longer owns a competing decoded pool.
