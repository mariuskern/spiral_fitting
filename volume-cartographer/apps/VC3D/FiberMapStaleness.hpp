    // an automatic rebuild is appropriate. Fibers and Umbilicus are the two
    // causes a rebuild genuinely fixes; Grid and VoxelSize commonly mean the
    // user is merely looking at a different volume right now, and rebuilding
    // into that transient frame would replace the map with one for a grid
    // the fibers are not annotated in.

// The whole decision, as a function of the two dependency sets.
//
// Three outcomes rather than two, because the changes are not equally severe:
//
//  - A different package leaves the layout meaningless: different fibers
//    entirely. Clearing is right.
//  - A different *grid* means the map is showing geometry for another set of
//    voxels - but the cause is usually the user LOOKING at a different
//    volume (the annotation frame follows the current volume), and that
//    reverts when they switch back. So it marks stale like every other
//    derived dependency rather than destroying a layout that becomes
//    correct again the moment the volume returns; the gates refuse
//    interaction while it differs, which is all clearing bought.
//  - Changed fibers, a changed umbilicus, or a changed voxel size leave it
//    out of date. The banner says so and the map refuses to act,
//    but the geometry survives for the rebuild. The voxel size belongs here
//    whether or not the umbilicus scale came from it: the layout's smoothing
//    sigma, resample step, label pads, panel tick and minimum gap are all
//    physical quantities converted through that figure, so a rebuild would
//    place things differently even where the umbilicus itself would not move.
//
// `latchedReason`, when non-empty, is staleness the holder asserted directly
// rather than derived from these sets — the defense paths that fire when an
// invariant looks violated (a fiber file name that no longer resolves under an
// unchanged generation). Nothing in the sets can prove it wrong, so it survives
// until the layout it describes is rebuilt or cleared. The clearing arms above
// it still outrank it, and a higher-priority derived reason may be *displayed*
// over it while its cause holds — so the holder must keep the latched wording
// in its own field, never in whatever the status line currently says.
// Everything derivable deliberately does NOT latch, which is what lets a
// dependency that changes back — a setting reverted, one scan's volume
// switched away and back — read as current again.
