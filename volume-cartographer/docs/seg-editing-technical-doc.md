# Segmentation Editing Architecture (Gaussian Vertex Mode)
*last update 10/25*
## Purpose and Scope

The segmentation editor lets annotators reshape an existing `QuadSurface` by
pulling its grid vertices with a Gaussian falloff. Editing operates directly on every valid vertex in the surface.

Unless noted otherwise, paths are relative to `apps/VC3D`.


## High-Level Data Flow

1. **Session start** – `SegmentationModule::beginEditingSession` receives the
   active `QuadSurface` from the segmentation tooling and forwards it to
   `SegmentationEditManager::beginSession`. The manager snapshots the original
   point grid for undo/reset, then edits the base surface in place
   (`SegmentationEditManager.cpp`).
2. **Vertex edit tracking** – The manager maintains an unordered-map of
   `VertexEdit { row, col, originalWorld, currentWorld, isGrowth }`. Entries are
   added or updated whenever a drag mutates a vertex. No falloff data is cached;
   neighbours are recomputed on demand.
3. **Interaction loop** – The module listens to mouse events from every
   `CVolumeViewer`, resolves the nearest vertex via
   `SegmentationEditManager::worldToGridIndex`, and drives the drag lifecycle:
   * `beginActiveDrag` snapshots the local neighbourhood inside the configured
     radius.
   * `updateActiveDrag` applies the Gaussian falloff to that sample set.
   * `commitActiveDrag` clears temporary caches once the drag ends.
   The module pushes preview updates back to `CSurfaceCollection` so the viewers
   render changes in real time.
4. **Overlay feedback** – `SegmentationOverlayController` now renders a single
   active marker plus the currently affected neighbours (as reported by
   `SegmentationEditManager::recentTouched`). During a drag it projects the
   Gaussian radius into viewer space so users understand the footprint.
5. **Persistence** – "Apply" simply bakes the current base grid into the
   original snapshot and clears the edit map (this also happens automatically
   after each committed drag). "Reset" discards active drags and copies the
   original snapshot back onto the base surface. A session ends by clearing
   overlay state and cached snapshots.


## Component Overview

| Component | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `SegmentationWidget` | Minimal Qt sidebar with an editing toggle, Gaussian controls (radius/sigma in grid steps), and Apply/Reset/Stop affordances. Growth volume selection is still exposed for downstream tooling. |
| `SegmentationModule` | Binds the widget, edit manager, overlay, and viewers. Routes input events, maintains drag/hover state, updates overlays, and exposes helper signals (status messages, growth requests). |
| `SegmentationEditManager` | Owns the undo snapshot (`_originalPoints`), the in-place preview pointer, vertex edit map, Gaussian sampling cache for active drags, and dirty tracking. Provides helpers to map world coordinates to grid indices and to query vertex positions. |
| `SegmentationOverlayController` | Draws the active vertex marker, affected neighbours, optional mask overlay points, and the projected Gaussian radius. |
| `QuadSurface` (core layer) | Stores the dense `cv::Mat_<cv::Vec3f>` grid and metadata that represent the segmentation patch. |


## Session Lifecycle

1. **Begin** – `SegmentationModule::beginEditingSession` primes the edit manager
   with the base surface, updates overlay parameters, and republishes that same
   surface through the shared collection so viewers refresh immediately.
2. **Edit** – All vertex mutations occur directly on the base surface while the
   module keeps `_originalPoints` as the reset snapshot. The module
   continuously mirrors dirty state back to the widget so the UI can flag
   pending changes.
3. **Apply / Reset** – `SegmentationEditManager::applyPreview` refreshes the
   original snapshot from the live surface (no extra copies into the base
   surface). `resetPreview` clears the edit map and copies `_originalPoints`
   back into the base surface.
4. **End** – `SegmentationModule::endEditingSession` cancels any active drag,
   clears overlay markers, and drops the cached snapshot state.


## Gaussian Falloff Workflow

- Radius and sigma are configured in **grid steps**. The manager converts those
  values to world units using the surface scale so the footprint is circular in
  world space.
- `beginActiveDrag` collects all valid vertices within the radius into
  `ActiveDrag::samples`. Each sample stores a pointer to the base world position
  and its squared distance (already in world units).
- `updateActiveDrag` computes the new world position for the centre vertex and
  applies a Gaussian weight to every sample: `exp(-(d^2)/(2*sigma^2))`. The
  preview grid is mutated in-place, the edit map updated, and the `recentTouched`
  cache refreshed for overlays.
- `commitActiveDrag` clears the temporary sample list. `cancelActiveDrag` reverts
  the affected vertices to their pre-drag positions.


## Interaction Model

### Mouse

- **Left click + drag** – Picks the nearest valid vertex, locks the Gaussian
  neighbourhood, and drags it along the viewer plane. Neighbours update on every
  move and the overlay highlights the active footprint.
- **Left click release** – Commits the drag and leaves the surface in its new
  state. Escape cancels the drag and restores the touched vertices.
- **Mouse wheel** – Adjusts the radius in quarter-step increments while showing
  a transient status message. The overlay radius indicator updates immediately.

Ctrl/Alt modifiers previously reserved for handle management are currently
unused.

### Keyboard

- **Esc** – Cancels the active drag.


## Overlay Behaviour

`SegmentationOverlayController` receives:

- `setActiveVertex(optional<VertexMarker>)` – Active or hovered vertex (row,
  col, world).
- `setTouchedVertices(vector<VertexMarker>)` – The neighbours that were updated
  during the last drag frame.
- `setGaussianParameters(radiusSteps, sigmaSteps, gridStepWorld)` – Used to
  project the radius indicator when an active drag is present.
- Optional mask overlay data for tooling parity.

The controller renders simple filled circles for neighbours, a highlighted circle
for the active vertex, and (during drag) an outline representing the world-space
radius.
